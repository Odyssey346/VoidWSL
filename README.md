Powered by [WSL-DistroLauncher](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL-DistroLauncher).

## Installation

Instructions are available on the latest release. You just install the Appx package and run the launcher from the Start menu, and do things from there.

## Building

You'll need a lot of crap, namely Visual Studio 2022 and the Windows SDK. Once you have these, you can clone VoidWSL and run the ``build.bat`` script. It will build everything for you and give you an Appx package in x64/Release.
